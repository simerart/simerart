          <p> I believe that as artist and designers we must evaluate our belief system and our personal purpose. As designers, we are taught that we must be socially conscious and create dialog by questioning beauty, politics and values. But our goal should also be focused on individually becoming passionate about something we love and exploring it to our deepest understanding. </p>

    I want to use Helvetica and Bodoni as much as I can to try to understand Beauty. I strive to make swiss style designs and then <strong class = "fuck">mess</strong> it up a little.</p> 
    
    <p class = "p2">My brain is falling out and only pizza can hold it together. I'm not kidding about this. That is real to me ;-)</p>
    
    <p class = "p3">How can I trust that this education will provide the opportunities I want to have? If you want to trust something you have to give it your trust. If I want to trust a place I have to give it my trust. Its not about being the best, its not about the work, its not about being challenged its about what I learn. How will I conduct my designs from a meta level, how do I approach design, how do I interact with it? what knowledge can I pull out from the students and teachers? Try not to think about what is going on around me, that I try to find my own word and not be oriented on whats going on in the moment. That I try to develop myself. </p>
    
    <p class= "p4">I wonder how racism plays into my career as a graphic designer (I’m afraid its my work that people don’t like or worse maybe its me as a person they don’t like, maybe I should spell my name with a K, Hektor Torres, that should do it).</p>
    
    <p class= "p5">This is me rambling for a paragraph or two. Art is anything but design. Why does it seem like some people are sleeping while awake? Not aware of the situation. Like zombies, some people get it they see trash and clean it up; Others make the trash. Thoughtlessness convenience, consumerism, it's all tied to capitalism. Sexing sales, eating meat. Meet your meat, I'm tired of meat and white privileged patriarchy, garbage, stuff, things that don’t bring joy. Decolonize our minds, deconstruct our society. Never mind all that I got my Pizza and it's so good for right now. Let me catch some Pokémon and take pills.</p>
    
    <p class= "p6"> Non violent guns. The truth is out there, trust no one. I forgive everything because beer. </p>
    
        <p class= "p7">Things I've learned, the future belongs to the ones who can afford it.</p> 
    
        <p class= "p8">I want to create a practice that merges social justice and graphic design.</p>
    
    <p class= "p9">Frame within frame within frame. Art can be anything but Design. Why is there a divide between graphic design and art then? Didn’t the Dadaist end all of that division? I am a graphic designer lets keep it real, I work for clients, I will work for clients for as long as they need me. I can be my own client. I have a tendency to want to feel secure so I like steady well paying jobs. Will this change? I like conveying the message, if the client wants a Barbie calendar I will engulf myself in the mind of a girl and channel it though my design and make it as empowering as their style guide will let me. But is the social responsibility of the designer meant to be designing a better products or to not design products at all? if we don’t design products, we break the chain of design and consumerism, we would have to reject capitalism. What would we design instead if we can’t design products, I guess we would become artists designing for ourselves, maybe digital/virtual designs. I am an actor/graphic designer, I act like the thing I’m designing for. <p>
    
    <p class= "p10">I don't like to waste paper or create waste, use plastic containers, packaging, newspapers. I avoid drinking straws. I don't eat meat and avoid anything that uses animal products, I am the change I want to see in the world. I don't design things that show animals in pain like bull riding or are about bacon or about food that contains meat. I try to be as conscious as I can, so far so good. I lean towards designs that are for the future world I envision. My goal is to elevate the designs I make to inspire people, to transcend my passion of design through the work I make. I want to think deep and be a better designer because of it. I want to go there and not be scared to find myself. </p>
